<!-- Here's your starting point. You will want to edit this file to include instructions for your users. 
    There should be an HTML form here which gets a string from a user, and sends that information to the backend
    to check if the color is a valid CSS color or not. -->
<p> Hey there! I've prepared a little game for you! Here's the idea:
<ul>
    <li>Write the name of a color</li>
    <li>If that color exists in CSS, the website should show you a new page which tells you that your color exists,
        while also display the name of the color and a swatch (square) of that color on the page. However, if the color
        does not
        in CSS, you should see a page telling you that the color name is not valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? Try it out yourself, old chap!</p>

<!-- when the user submits this form, it will send the information submitted from the client (frontend)
    to the server (backend). It will send that infromation to a particular URI, at "/color". 
    Your server will then run the code which is defined in website.py at that route. -->

<form action="/color" method="post">
    <!-- add the contents of your form here -->
    <label for="name"> Color: </label>
    <input type="text" name="color" id="color" required pattern="[A-Za-z]+">
</form>

</p>
