<h4>The Story of CODE</h4>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>When our chancellor Thomas Bachem – self-taught software engineer and designer – was looking for study
            programs to promote his endeavors as an internet entrepreneur, he was disappointed to see that the academic
            landscape mostly focused on the never-changing basic principles of Computer Science, instead of the exciting
            new possibilities of the internet and its opportunities.</td>
        <td>He decided to study Economics at a private business school in Cologne, which is where he experienced
            firsthand the radical drive to apply academic theories to the real world and a personal, supportive learning
            environment. Out of both his fruitless search for a truly applied software-engineering program and his
            revolutionary experience at the private university, the idea for CODE was born: CODE would be to Computer
            Science what business schools are to classic Economics programs.</td>
        <td>One decade later, Thomas had already founded several successful internet startups. As an entrepreneur and
            employer, he discovered time and time again that good software engineers, designers and product managers –
            the key drivers for ambitious digital companies – are a rare resource in Europe and Germany in particular
            because classical university programs rarely qualify young men and women for the challenges of the new
            economy.</td>
